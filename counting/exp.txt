counting:

 -set of n distinct items
  choose k items with replacements, order matters
  n*n*n     k =3         n^k

   -set of n distinct items
  choose k items , order matters
  n*(n-1)*(n-2) = npk

  -set of n distinct items
  choose k items k<=n

  npk - (extraaaaaaaaa)
  n = 5 k = 3 set{1,5,4}
  1 5 4
  1 4 5
  5 4 1
  5 1 4
  4 5 1
  4 1 5
  6 WAYS you need to remove them for each set
  npk/x and x here k! === ncr

 we can also call them as subset of size k from a set of n dist items
 n C k = n C (n-k)

 nC0 + nC1 + nC2 + ... + nCn = 2^n
 we can take subset of size 0 or subset of size 1 of subset of size 2 ... until subset of size n
 it means all possibles of the items take or leave


 ----------
 if we have set of n-1 items = {1 .. n-1}
 and set of size n = {1 ... n}

 I need subset of size k
 we have two options
 if we have n so the num of k remaining will be k-1     n-1 C k-1
 or if we dont have n we will choose k items --> n-1 C k
n-1 C k + n-1 C k-1 =

                    1
                  1   1
                 1  2  1
                1  3  3  1
               1  4  6  4  1
              1  5  10  10  5 1
pascal triangle
bounderies should be 1 and each cell is summation of the two numbers above them
 formula  = nCk = n-1 C k-1 + n-1 C k

 (X+Y)^n = (X+Y).(x+y).(x+y)....... n times
 I need the coefficient of X(i) y(n-i)
 choose i brackets from n
 nCi
                            (X+Y)^n  = sigma (n C i) (X^i) Y(n-i)
 if you notice that
 (x+y)^2 =  1 x^2 + 2 xy + 1 y^2
 (x+y)^3 = 1 x^3 + 3 x^2 y + 3 x y^2 + y ^ 3
          1 2 1
          1 3 3 1
          1 4 6 4 1
          pascalllllllllllllll
          so that it is called binomial coefficient نظرية ذات الحدين

 - if we need to calc sigma i from 0 to n (n C i) = (1+1)^n = 2^n

 importanttttttttttttttt
 n candies -- > identical
 k children --> distinct
 n = 3 k = 2
 n stars and k -1 bars represent distinct way
 *| * | *
 bijection = one_to_one relation
  means each string represent a new way

  n stars and k -1 bars
  I have size of n + k -1
  If I determine the positions of stars and the remaining will be stars
  so choose k-1
  n+k-1 C k-1
-----------------------------
 if I want to count number of paths from (0,0) to (5,5)
 and you can only go down or right
 if I have string has n rights and n downs so it corresponds to path
 count string that represent n rights and n downs
 (2*n C n) like the candies


----
 another version
  if I want to count number of paths from (0,0) to (5,5) but dont cross the line segment y = x

  get the total minus the extraaa
  total = 2n C n
  count the paths that cross this diagonal
  proof in the video that each path corresponds from (-1,1) --> (n,n)
  ==== path from (0,0) --> (n,n) cross the x
  one to one relation
  n+1 down and n - 1 right
  (2n Cn) - (2n C n+1)
   2n C n - 2n C n+1 == catalan number = Cn = (2n C n)/(n+1) = (2*(2n-1))/(n+1))*(C n-1)


  --- another sol for this version
  you can notice that if you go right two times you can not go down more than two times
  example
  D >= R
  DRR (it doesnot work)
  each D represent ( and each R)
  DDRDRR
  (()()) if the path doesn't corresponds to a regular sequence
 it is logically right because when you check the sequence. make variable and if it is open +1 and close -1
 and if the variable is smaller than 0, it is not bracket sequence and this is what we need no one cross the other
 D >= R
 so number of regular bracket sequences == no of ways from 0 0 to n,n which don't cross
 size of 2n pairs
 bracket sequence of n pairs of brackets
 (......)
 ()(n-1)-- > c0 * Cn-1
 (1)(n-2) --> C1 Cn-2
 (2)(n-3)--> C2 Cn-3
 (0)(n-1) --> C0 Cn-1
 so the sum is the catalan number

 so number of regular bracket sequence of n pairs = sigma C(i)* C(n-i-1) = Cn catalan number

 -------------
 مهمممممممممممممممممممممممممم
 sigma C(i)* C(n-i-1) = Cn catalan number = (2n Cn) - (2n C n+1)

 n sided convex polygon , divide n-2 triangles,such that sides of triangles dont cross
